This project equips the learner with hands-on knowledge on;
    - DOM Manipulation
    - Web Storage
    - Working with JSON


This is made possible by doing the following projects:

### 1. Project One

##### Task Description:

Develop a web application that dynamically generates content based on user input and interactions.
This project will provide hands-on experience with creating, modifying, and managing elements in the DOM,
demonstrating the core capabilities of JavaScript for building interactive web pages.



### 2. Project Two

##### Task Description:

Expand the functionality of the “Dynamic Quote Generator” to include a filtering system based on categories.
Users will be able to select a category and see only the quotes that match this category. This involves manipulating
the DOM to dynamically update the displayed content and using web storage to remember the user’s last selected filter
across sessions.



### 3. Project Three

##### Task Description:
This task involves setting up a simple simulation of server interactions to sync local quote data and resolve conflicts.
You’ll enhance the application’s robustness by ensuring that data remains consistent across different sessions and devices,
simulating a real-world application environment.
